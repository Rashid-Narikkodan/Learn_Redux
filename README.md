# 🚀 Redux Practice Repo

This repository is my personal space to learn and practice Redux step by step.
I use it to understand how global state, actions, and reducers work in real React apps.

✨ It contains small experiments, examples, and patterns that help me get better at Redux.
⭐ The goal is to become confident using Redux in real projects.
